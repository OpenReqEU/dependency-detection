NOTE 3 Other elements that will be taken into account (I)\n\t- train coupling and decoupling shall be done by shunting. This is why the description of the related operations shall not be subject to this document;\n\t\t- no temporary shunting areas shall be used.
NOTE 8. The transition from SRS 222 to SRS 230d is a minor and recent update of the software version used for the ETCS equipment (OBU, RBC, LEU, balises). Because the update is minor, the maturity of the solutions based on SRS 230d may include the maturity of the solutions based on SRS 222 and 230. Because the update is recent, at the time of the launch of this call for tenders, there are very few actual implementations of SRS 230d-based solutions. Therefore, for the assessment of the proposed solution, CFR accepts the inclusion of solutions based on SRS 222 and 230. (I)
RBC 88 The revocation of an MA (from the OBU) must be executed by the RBC by means of an emergency stopping message sent by the RBC. When it receives an emergency stopping message, the OBU confirms whether the MA revocation has been executed. (LC)
RBC 89 The emergency STOP message, as an independent command initiated by the controller for a specific train, shall be implemented (LC).
NOTE 15 It must be possible to stop all the trains from a certain area (no smaller than a station or open line between two stations), with a single stop command executed in the electronic interlocking installation. (I\/LC-EI)
a) if the train stops on the first section without switch (before the switch, in the running direction), the route shall be unlocked after 180 seconds.
c) The shortening of the MA must be done in such a manner that:
\t- OBU remains in the mode it was when stopping on the first section.
\t- when the exit signal is set to “CLEAR”, because this command locks behind it the sections of the siding line, an MA (MA1) shall be issued from the signal behind, in order for the
OBU to be able to reach the signal, as follows:
RBC 120 If the OBU is on a route (in a station) and the TMCO activates the DFP for that route, the MA shall be immediately cancelled. (LC)
The first block sector (IAD) represents the line block between the home signals,
The second block sector, \"IIAD\", becomes occupied when:\nthe output route from station B is set (e.g., X2->TCY),  \nthe output route is totally locked,\nthe beginning section of the output route becomes occupied (e.g., section 2).
Remark: In this case of direct dependency between stations, the EI installation must allow for red to red dependency if CFR requires this type of dependency.
IABS in station A includes the following elements:\nIAD block sector (in this case, section 003),\nIIAD block sector (in this case, section 005),\nDistant signal Pr.X,\nInterface element.
Block orientation can only be defined via the special commands \"SOBB\/COBB\".  
If the block has no orientation, the setting of output routes must be rejected.
After the \"COBB\/COBB\" command is given, the block is oriented in the requested direction (Fig. 13, direction A to B) and block signals may be cleared. The block signals in the direction opposite to the block must remain on the \"Stop\" indication.
If the interface does not function, all block signals (clear signals) must be automatically set on the \"Stop\" indication.
If an output route is set and the interface does not function, the departure signal must be automatically set on the \"Stop\" indication (the indicator covering the route is flashing green).
The interface does not function when:\nThe physical connection between stations is interrupted,\nThe communication is stopped,\nThe media convertor is faulty,\nThe system is restarted.
If the interface is faulty, the manual or automatic block orientation is not possible (it is rejected).
If the interface is faulty, the \"DESV\" command must be rejected.
If the block is oriented and the interface no longer functions, the block orientation is not lost. In this case, after the communication is restored (the interface functions), the block orientation must be the same as before the interface failure,  
After the interface is restored, the stations must transmit to each other the last status of the block orientation direction.
Additionally to the GSM-R dialling scenarios, due to the high security requirements in railway operations, GSM-R requires verified solutions, as required by a high-quality service, fast call initiation and other features needed to meet all operational requirements.

Works on the project of reconstructing the existing and constructing the second track on the section Dugo Selo – Križevci (subsections Dugo Selo – Vrbovec and Vrbovec – Križevci) must be completed in entirety within four (4) years from the day of the Beginning of Works.
The supervisory centre for PS2+2Bv Dugo Selo is situated in Zagreb. The computer of the KKU is connected to the central computer system at the Remote Control Centre.
The system for detecting and reporting fire (fire-alarm system) must encompass all areas within the facility which could be in danger of fire. Analog addressable fire-alarm system is foreseen with automatic, optical and thermical fire notifiers, and on evacuation ways manual fire notifiers have been  placed.
Within the scope of the project, at the subject railway station the construction of new auxiliary roads and relocation of the existing ones is planned.
Parallelly with the construction of the superstructure of the rail the foundations for the noise protection walls should be built. The walls’ heights on the subject section are 3.0 to 5.0 m, The walls are positioned at a distance of 4.0-5.5 m from the exterior track axis. Within the railway station Dugo Selo barriers are adjusted to the facilities formation (platforms, pedestrian ways, channels, cables).
On the left side of the rail total 964 m of wall should be built and on the right side approx. 300m.
The reconstruction of the railway station Dugo Selo requires the construction of the rail on deviation M103 Dugo Selo – Novska to Ostrna. New railway station Dugo Selo is constructed  in a way to extend the route towards east. On the east side of the railway station a two-track rail on the route Dugo Selo – Križevci is planned and  two-track rail on the route Dugo Selo – Novska.
In this phase on the route M103 Dugo Selo – Novska to Ostrna one track should be built (1N) and a planum for the other track of total length approx. 1400m. Towards Novska the existing rail is retained as a main rail for the purposes of commercial areas. From this rail the industrial rail to Dalekovod is separated.
On the rail deviation the reinforced embankment is 30-50 cm thick. Due to bad characteristics of the ground, along with the geotextile and geonetwork which are placed onto adapted foundation, another layer of geonetwork onto the reinforced embankment should be put.
Culverts’ construction works should be performed during dry periods (periods of low waters).
The rail on the deviation passes over drainage channels under small angle and therefore the melioration channel MK1 134 m long and the lateral channel LK1 237 m long should be regulated. The existing profile of the channels is retained.
Steel parts of brackets are protected from corrosion by hot corrugation and the fixings are cast of aluminium bronze and the screws of stainless steel.
Drive conduits are firmly and automatically strained.
Two PP40 (NYCY) type cables have been laid to reach each disconnector’s power engine unit. The cables are laid in one piece, as feasible (technological, production length of cables is up to 1000 m). If the cables are extended, both cables shall be extended at the same point.
